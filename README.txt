Sample PHP Project.

Example of php in use on a simple site where a user can log in and view posts
associated with that account. No way to add new posts yet, that can be added
later.

As an excercise to the reader (you know who you are) I intentionally left out
any comments and used horribly short variable names. Your job is to add correct
comments and rename variables to things that make sense.

If you want to run this, (assuming you're running WAMP or LAMP) copy it into
your www folder.

When you're done, push this as a new repository to your account and send me a
pull request - I'll merge in the most readable code to this repository as a
solution.
